              Insights currently serves three user groups: teachers, school
              administrators, and internal EP staff. Each group requires
              different datasets all readily available on the interface, leading
              to overcrowding and diluting their benefits.
              <br />
              <br />
              We found that school admin and internal staff relied more on ad
              hoc reporting methods over Insights and on top of plans to develop
              a separate admin panel specifically for these users, the PM and I
              decided to reprioritize Insights as a teachers-first product.

              Following the structure of the new IA, I iterated on prototypes of

              The current Insights graph only shows "hours online" over time,
              along with a few raw metrics that users found less meaningful,
              like activities and questions answered. Based on feedback, I chose
              four key variables for the graphs: logins, time spent, tasks
              completed, and assessments completed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Initially, users could select multiple variables at once, but
              testing showed this added no value, so I switched to a toggle
              option. Each variable includes a percentage change from the
              previous period to help teachers quickly spot trends, with
              on-hover tooltips explaining the reference period.

              bars are now in a neutral blue with low accuracy highlighted in

              concerned about individual scores than growth across assessments,

              The first couple of design sprints concluded with live usability
              testing with internal users. These initial tests uncovered bugs
              and allowed me to carefully refine what data was available to
              users and how it is displayed.
              <br />
              <br />
              The final prototype was deployed on Maze for unmoderated testing,
              where users completed tasks to assess usability and answered
              survey questions on dataset usefulness and accessibility. Users
              achieved a ~90% task success rate, with most errors stemming from
              unclear microinteractions, like the comparison tool in the
              Assessment tab. I addressed these issues with alternative designs.
              The post-test survey showed an average satisfaction score of 7.5
              out of 10, with most users preferring the redesigned experience
              over the current interface.

              The last round of testing on Maze allowed me to get quick high
              level feedback from a larger pool of users. Access to survey
              answers, click heatmaps, and success metrics uncovered areas of
              concern that guided my final set of edits before the conclusion of
              my internship. All my research artifacts along with the Figma
              prototype were thoroughly annotated with design justifications and
              explanations where valuable.
